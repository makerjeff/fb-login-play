#FB Login Play

##Instructions

##Tutorial Base
- [FB-Login Quickstart](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1310049252373886/fb-login/quickstart/);

##Notes
- The **git push -u** flag sets the upstream, which let's git know to always push to this location. Without the **-u** flag, it'll require you to designate the location every time.
- The tutorial uses a simple function to inject a JS script to the html.  Great way to load external modules dynamically.
